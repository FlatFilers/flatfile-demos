# flatfile-demos
This is where demos for testing Flatfile are stored. Below is a list of the demos currently available. To run a demo, navigate into the directory of the demo you would like to try and run 'npm install' then 'npm run start'. Optionally, you can use our npx script to download and start the demo of your choice with `npx @flatfile/try [framework] [project]`. So for example, you could get the react basic demo with `npx @flatfile/try react basic`.
